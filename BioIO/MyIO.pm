=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 getFh

        Arg [0]    : Type of file to open, reading '<', writing '>', appending '>>'
        Arg [1]    : Name of file to open
        Example    : my $fh = getFh('<', $infile);

        Description: This will return a filehandle to the file passed in.  This function
                     can be used to open, write, and append, and get the File Handle. You are 
                     best giving the absolute path, but since we are using this Module in the same directory 
                     as the calling scripts, we are fine.
        Returntype : A filehandle

        Status     : Stable
